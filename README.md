# Language Identification with Natural Language Processing: A Multilingual Text Analysis Project
Language detection models enable multilingual support, personalized content, and global data analysis. They optimize translation services, enhance cybersecurity, and improve e-commerce and search engine functionality. Essential for efficient digital interactions, these models ensure precise communication and tailored user experiences across languages and applications.

Developed a Language Detection project utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This project accurately identifies and categorizes text data into different languages. 
# How to Run

To execute the language detection model:

1. **File Overview**: The project comprises 2 folders and 4 files.
2. **Download**: Begin by downloading all files.
3. **Dataset**: Utilize the `Languages_detection_22000.csv` dataset for model training.
4. **Jupyter Notebook**: Access `language_detection.ipynb` to view and run the NLP model code.
5. **Configuration**: Ensure to adjust file directories in the code to match your input data locations before execution.
